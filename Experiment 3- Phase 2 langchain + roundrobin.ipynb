      "Customer_Proxy:\n",
      "Customer_Proxy: The project plan seems comprehensive and aligns well with our requirements for a fully automated DevSecOps pipeline. However, I would like to suggest a few adjustments:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tool Selection and Architecture Design**: Please ensure that we consider open-source tools where possible to minimize costs. Additionally, it would be beneficial to have a cross-team meeting to decide on the tools collectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Integration of Security Tools**: Along with SAST and DAST, could we also explore integrating dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in third-party libraries?\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Compliance and Audit Logging**: It would be great to discuss the specific compliance frameworks we need to adhere to (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) during the compliance and logging setup.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Documentation and Training**: I would prefer the training sessions to be hands-on workshops rather than just presentations, to ensure better understanding and adoption of the new pipeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Timeline**: If possible, I would appreciate a more detailed timeline with specific dates for each milestone to help us plan our internal resources accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please relay these adjustments to the Project Manager and let me know if further discussions are needed. Thank you!\n",
