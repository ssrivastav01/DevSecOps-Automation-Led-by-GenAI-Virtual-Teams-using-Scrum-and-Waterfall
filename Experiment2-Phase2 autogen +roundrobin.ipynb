      "    f. OWASP ZAP for security scanning.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Estimated Work:\n",
      "Based on the outlined components and workflow, the estimated work breakdown is as follows:\n",
      "    a. Designing CI/CD workflows: 2 days\n",
      "    b. Integrating source control management: 1 day\n",
      "    c. Setting up CI server (Jenkins): 2 days\n",
      "    d. Configuring static code analysis (SonarQube): 1 day\n",
      "    e. Implementing containerization (Docker): 2 days\n",
      "    f. Developing infrastructure as code (Terraform): 2 days\n",
      "    g. Integrating security scanning tools: 1 day\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Conclusion:\n",
      "The DevSecOps pipeline design document outlines the key components, workflow, tools, and estimated work required to establish an automated development process with integrated security measures. This pipeline aims to enhance collaboration, accelerate software delivery, and ensure codebase security throughout the development lifecycle.\n",
