#DevSecOps Automation with GenAI-Driven Virtual Teams Using Scrum and Waterfall Methodology
This project delivers a comprehensive DevSecOps automation pipeline, created through a blend of the Waterfall and Scrum methodologies across two phases. The first phase establishes core components and follows a structured Waterfall approach, while the second phase transitions into Scrum to adaptively enhance features and introduce roles for dynamic, iterative improvements.

##Project Overview
###Phase 1: Implement a fully automated DevSecOps pipeline using the Waterfall model. This phase defines key components including CI/CD automation, security integration, and infrastructure provisioning.
###Phase 2: Shift to an agile, Scrum-based approach with GenAI-supported virtual team roles to refine the system. Roles are added for adaptability, enabling efficient collaboration across various tasks and fostering continuous improvement.
##Key Technologies and Frameworks
AutoGen and LangChain frameworks power GenAI-driven communication and task allocation.
Core DevSecOps Technologies: Integrates with CI/CD systems, security testing (SAST, DAST), and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools.
Virtual Team Agents: Created through AI frameworks to simulate project roles, facilitate interaction, and optimize workflow across project phases.
##Project Phases
###Phase 1: Waterfall Methodology for Core Pipeline Setup
This phase establishes the DevSecOps pipeline foundation through sequential stages. Each virtual team agent performs dedicated tasks in a structured manner, completing their assigned project deliverables without iterative changes.

###Roles:

###Customer Proxy: Communicates client requirements to the project team.
###Project Manager: Oversees initial planning and coordinates across roles.
###Requirement Engineer: Gathers and documents DevSecOps requirements, detailing use cases for pipeline automation.
###System Engineer: Designs the system architecture, focusing on CI/CD, security, and IaC.
###Software Engineer: Develops automation features according to the System Engineerâ€™s design.
###Test Engineer: Ensures all automation features meet standards through rigorous testing.
###Documentation Engineer: Prepares user documentation and training materials.

##Outputs:

Project requirements document
System design document
Source code for core automation features
Test plan and test case results
User documentation

##Phase 2: Transition to Scrum with GenAI Virtual Team Roles
In Phase 2, the project adapts to Scrum, enabling flexibility and iterative development. New roles like Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Business Analyst are introduced, enhancing collaboration and continuous improvement through sprint cycles. GenAI-driven agents facilitate agile ceremonies, including stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.

###Roles Added in Phase 2:

###Product Owner: Defines and prioritizes backlog items, aligning development with customer goals.
###Scrum Master: Manages sprint cycles, supports team focus, and mitigates blockers.
###Release Manager: Oversees pipeline deployment and releases.
###Architect: Ensures system scalability, performance, and adherence to security best practices.
###Business Analyst: Bridges technical requirements and business needs.
###Sprint Structure:

Sprint planning identifies goals and allocates tasks.
Daily stand-ups track progress and address blockers.
Sprint reviews showcase completed work, gathering feedback for refinements.
Retrospectives identify areas for improvement.
Experiment Outputs
Detailed outputs from Phase 2 experiments demonstrate the project's evolution. Key achievements include:

Streamlined Communication: Agents coordinated across roles, emulating real-world Scrum practices.
Automation Efficiency: Improvements in CI/CD, SAST, and DAST integrations, providing measurable enhancements in security and deployment processes.
Enhanced Documentation: Comprehensive training materials were created, enhancing the onboarding experience.

###Run Experiments:

Experiment 1: Predefined sequence communication.
Experiment 2: Round-robin task distribution.
Experiment 3: Nested task handling for complex workflows.
Experiment 4: Sequential tasks with adaptive roles.

###Conclusion
This project demonstrates the synergy of GenAI, DevSecOps, and agile methodologies. The dual-phase approach showcases the effectiveness of Waterfall for foundational tasks and the flexibility of Scrum for iterative enhancements, making it a powerful case study in DevSecOps automation.
